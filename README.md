#| Ass#2 Overview

A program P in FL is a list of function definitions. The FL interpreter takes such a program, together with a function application, and returns the result of evaluating the application. This evaluation is based on the principle of "replacing equals by equals". Your interpreter should be defined as a Lisp function

(fl-interp E P)

which, given a program P and an expression E, returns the result of evaluating E with respect to P.

The language FL includes a number of primitive functions that should be implemented in your interpreter. FL, as specified below, resembles a subset of Lisp without an environment -- FL does not have a special form "defun" to create permanent named functions.
